# Overview
My goal in creating this program is to practice data analysis with the Python Pandas library. I wanted to learn more about data analysis
and use Pandas to help me answer some questions I came up with based on the dataset I chose. Knowing how to manipulate and tease answers out of 
data is quite powerful, as is data analysis as whole. Much of the world today is driven by data.

The dataset I am analyzing is a collection of air quality data taken from cities all over the United States on Janaury 1, 2018.
I obtained the data from Kaggle.com at this url: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yakhyojon/air-quality-data/

My purpose for writing this software to analyze the data was to learn more about which cities in the U.S. have the worst air quality.
I also wanted to know which states have the lowest average aqi, which I could then use to learn which states have the cleanest air.
The software I wrote helped me answer these questions.

Below is a link to a demo video of the program which includes an explanation of the dataset and code.

# Data Analysis Results

Question 1: Which cities have the worst air quality?
    1. Phoenix, Arizona (West Phoenix Site) - AQI: 50
    2. Las Vegas, Nevada - AQI: 41
    3. Compton, California - AQI: 40
    4. Phoenix, Arizona (South Phoenix Site) - AQI: 36
    5. San Bernardino, California - AQI: 28

Question 2: Which 10 states have the best average air quality?
       State - Avg AQI
    1. Lousiana - 0.00
    2. South Carolina - 1.00
    3. Wyoming - 1.67
    4. Tennessee 2.00
    5. Oregon - 2.00
    6. North Dakota - 2.00
    7. North Carolina - 2.00
    8. New Hampshire - 2.00
    9. Montana - 2.00
    10. Wisconsin - 2.00

Question 3: Are all of the U.S. states represented at least once in the dataset?
    Yes

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used Visual Studio Code.
I created this program using Python and its Pandas library, as well as the Matplotlib.
